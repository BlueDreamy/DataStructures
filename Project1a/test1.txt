Soon after the end of the German occupation of Greece, the issue of
establishing a University on Crete was brought up and reached its peak during
the 1960's. However, although public demand for the establishment of a
university on Crete was unanimous, there was also an intense rivalry between
the two major cities on the island on which one would become the seat of that
university. Finally, the solution to the problem was given in 1977 by the then
Prime Minister Konstantinos Karamanlis, who made a balanced decision approving
both the establishment of a University with faculties in Heraklion and
Rethymnon and the establishment of a Technical University in Chania.
